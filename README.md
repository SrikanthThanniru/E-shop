#Frontend Development Assignment: E-commerce Website


<!-- Objectives:
Framework:
Use any frontend framework: Angular, React, or Nextjs.
Focus on building a clean, modular, and scalable architecture using your chosen framework.
Login Flow and Role-Based Access:
Implement a user login page where users can authenticate using a username and password.
Set up role-based access control for users (e.g., admin, regular user). Admins should have access to certain pages (e.g., product management) that regular users cannot access.
The login state should be maintained, and users should be redirected to appropriate pages based on their roles after logging in.
Product Listing and Search:
Build a page that lists available products fetched from the JSON Server or similar tools.
Include a search functionality that allows users to filter products by name, category, or price range.
Implement pagination for the product listing to ensure a smooth user experience with large data sets.
Cart Functionality:
Allow users to add products to the cart.
Implement functionality to update the quantity or remove items from the cart.
Provide a clear cart summary page where users can view all their selected items and the total price before proceeding to checkout.
Placing an Order:
Implement a final checkout page where users can review their cart and confirm the order.
Provide visual feedback (e.g., order confirmation screen) after successfully placing the order.
JSON Server for Backend Simulation:
Use JSON Server or similar tools to simulate backend API calls for product listing, cart management, and order placement.
You do not need to build backend APIs, but you should replicate API calls to fetch data from the JSON Server, perform cart operations, and simulate order placement. -->
